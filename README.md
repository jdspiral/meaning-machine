# Meaning Machine

**See how language models fragment, encode, and simulate meaning.**

Meaning Machine is an interactive demo that lets you explore what your sentence looks like to a machine ‚Äî from tokenization to embeddings, grammar trees, and beyond.

---

## What It Does

- Enter any sentence (default: *"The young student didn't submit the final report on time."*)
- See how models **tokenize** and **encode** your words
- Explore **POS tagging** and **dependency parsing**
- Visualize **BERT embeddings** in 2D
- Extract **Subject‚ÄìVerb‚ÄìObject (SVO)** triples from your text
- Learn how machines simulate understanding through structure, not grounding

---

## Why It Matters
LLMs don‚Äôt ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù language like humans do. They simulate meaning through statistical patterns, not embodied experience.

- They don‚Äôt know what a dog feels like.

- But they know what often comes after ‚Äúpet the‚Ä¶‚Äù

**Meaning Machine** lets you see how this works ‚Äî and why it matters in an era where AI writes resumes, moderates speech, and shapes how truth circulates.

## How It Works

Built with:
- **Streamlit** for UI
- **spaCy** for grammar & dependency parsing
- **HuggingFace Transformers** for tokenization and BERT embeddings
- **Plotly** + **PCA** for interactive visualization
